Purpose: This program allows two users to message each other on different command lines. 
It uses peer-to-peer to connect the users, the server will act like a client, and 
another client will connect. The first instance that gets called with no parameter will 
be the server, and the second will act like the client. After both clients connect, the  
messaging can start. Only one user can message at the time, and afterwards, they must  
wait for the other to respond. Each time a message is sent, it gets encrypted and  
decrypted when received. Both users can see the encrypted and decrypted message. As soon 
as one user inputs “quit”, the program quits for both after having that message sent to the other user.
